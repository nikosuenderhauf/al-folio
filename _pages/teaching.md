In my role as an educator at QUT, I enjoy teaching Introduction to Robotics (EGB339) and Mechatronics Design 3 (EGH419) to our undergraduate students in the Mechatronics degree.

I also lectured at the [2019 IEEE Summer School on Robot Vision](http://robotvision2019.amtc.cl/) in Santiago, Chile and at the [Robotic Vision Summer School](https://www.roboticvision.org/rvss2019/) organised by the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision.
