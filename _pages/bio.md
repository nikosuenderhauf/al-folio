After graduating with a Master's degree in computer science (German "Diplom-Informatiker") from [Chemnitz University of Technology](http://www.tu-chemnitz.de) in Germany in 2006, I obtained my PhD degree at the chair of [Automation Technology](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/en/index.html) at TU Chemnitz, supervised by [Prof. Peter Protzel](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/en/team/peterProtzel.html) in April 2012. For my [PhD thesis](http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:ch1-qucosa-86443) I focused on robust graph-based models for SLAM and probabilistic estimation.

After two more years as a postdoc in Chemnitz I joined the Robotics and Autonomous Systems [Group](https://research.qut.edu.au/ras/) at at Queensland University of Technology ([QUT](http://www.qut.edu.au)) in Brisbane in March 2014. In August 2014 I became a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the [Australian Centre for Robotic Vision](http://www.roboticvision.org) at QUT.

I joined the faculty at QUT in 2017 as a Lecturer (roughly equivalent to a tenured Assistant Professor position in the US system)  and have been promoted to [Senior Lecturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_lecturer) in 2018. I was appointed Chief Investigator of the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision in 2018.

I conduct research in robotic vision, at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. My research interests are focus on scene understanding, [semantic SLAM](http://www.semanticslam.ai), and new ways to incorporate semantics into reinforcement learning. I furthermore lead a project on [new benchmarking challenges in robotic vision](http://www.roboticvisionchallenge.org).
I regularly organise [workshops](../workshops) at robotics and computer vision conferences, such as RSS, CVPR, and ICRA.

#### Reviews and Community Service

I am **Associate Editor** for the IEEE [Robotics and Automation Letters journal](http://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l) (RA-L), and for the IEEE [International Conference on Robotics and Automation](http://www.icra2018.org) (ICRA). I have been serving regularly as a **reviewer** for the major journals (IJRR, TRO, RAS, IJFR) and major conferences (RSS, CoRL, ICRA, IROS, FSR, Intelligent Vehicles Symposium) in our field for many years.

I served as an **Assessor** for the Australian Research Council (ARC) and provided expert reviews on a total of four proposals for the ARC's Discovery Programme 2016 and 2017.

I was coordinating **guest editor** for a special issue of the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR) on the topic of Deep Learning in Robotics, published in 2018. I am guest editor for a special issue of the International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV) on the topic of Deep Learning for Robotic Vision, to be published 2019.
