### PhD Students

You want to do a PhD in robotics? Great! If you are interested in the topics listed below, please contact me via email and include:
 * your CV
 * academic transcript
 * a one page description of your research interests.

Please understand that due to the high volume of PhD applications I receive, I might not be able to respond to your email. This is especially the case if you did not attach the documents listed above, or if your research interests are not aligned with mine. I will be in touch if I think you would be a good fit to our lab.

I am happy to advise PhD students interested in the following **topics**:
 * semantic SLAM, object-based SLAM
 * scene Understanding
 * robot learning for navigation and interaction

Please also refer to the [QUT Centre for Robotics website for PhD applicants](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/engagement/study-with-us/).
