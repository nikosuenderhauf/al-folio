I am very active in organising workshops that help bringing the computer vision, machine learning, and robotics research communities closer together again.

[**Long-term autonomy and deployment of intelligent robots in the real-world**](http://longtermautonomy.eu/) (ICRA 2018)

This workshop (led by [Feras Dayoub](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fstaff.qut.edu.au%2Fstaff%2Fdayoub%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE-tlKEvYVgIqZ5312cYTJILFal0g)) discussed the challenges of autonomous robots that have to reliably operate for long  periods of time while having to demonstrate a high level of robustness and fault tolerance.

[**New Frontiers for Deep Learning in Robotics**](http://juxi.net/workshop/deep-learning-rss-2017/) (RSS 2017)

A wide range of renowned experts discussed deep learning techniques at the frontier of research that are not yet widely adopted, discussed, or well-known in our community. We carefully selected research topics such as Bayesian deep learning, generative models, or deep reinforcement learning for planning and navigation that are of high relevance and potentially groundbreaking for robotic perception, learning, and control. The workshop introduces these techniques to the robotics audience, but also exposes participants from the machine learning community to real-world problems encountered by robotics researchers that apply deep learning in their research.

Organised with the support of Jürgen Leitner, Michael Milford, Peter Corke (QUT, Brisbane), and Pieter Abbeel (UC Berkeley).

[**Are the Sceptics Right? - Limits and Potentials of Deep Learning in Robotics**](http://juxi.net/workshop/deep-learning-rss-2016/) (RSS 2016)

We analysed why deep learning has not yet had the huge impact in robotics it had in neighboring research disciplines, and especially in computer vision. The workshop will identify the limits and potentials of current deep learning techniques in robotics, and will propose directions for future research to overcome those limits and realize the promising potentials.

Co-organisers were Jürgen Leitner, Michael Milford, Ben Upcroft, Peter Corke (QUT, Brisbane), Pieter Abbeel (UC Berkeley), Wolfram Burgard (Uni Freiburg).

[**Visual Place Recognition: What is it good for?**](http://tinyurl.com/vprice-RSS16) (RSS 2016)

This half-day workshop, co-organised with Ben Upcroft, Michael Milford (QUT, Brisbane), and Peer Neubert (TU Chemnitz), focussed on concepts and ideas for robust vision‐based place recognition in severely changing environments as well as discussing the extent to which place recognition is useful, or even required for robots.

[**Visual Place Recognition in Changing Environments**](http://www.tinyurl.com/vprice-ICRA15) (ICRA 2015)

This half-day workshop at ICRA 2015 in Seattle built on the highly successful 2014 workshop of the same name at ICRA, and discussed novel concepts and ideas for robust vision-based place recognition in severely changing environments. Organised with Peter Corke and Michael Milford.

Around 130 people followed the invited talks and paper presentations in a large ballroom.

[**Visual Place Recognition in Changing Environments**](http://www.tinyurl.com/vprice-cvpr15) (CVPR 2015)

This workshop continued the discussion from the previous year at ICRA and addressed the computer vision community at CVPR. Organised with Peter Corke and Michael Milford (QUT, Brisbane), and Torsten Sattler (ETH Zürich).

Approximately 40 people came by for talks and poster presentations. It was great to interact with the authors and of course the invited speakers Josef Sivic and John Leonard at CVPR as well as David Cox and Chi Hay Tong at ICRA. Thanks everybody for contributing!

[**Visual Place Recognition in Changing Environments**](http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/ICRAWorkshopChangingEnvironments) (ICRA 2014)

Organised with Peter Corke and Michael Milford (QUT, Brisbane).
We discussed novel concepts and ideas for robust vision-based place recognition in severely changing environments. Such changes – induced e.g. by the time of day, weather or seasonal effects as well as human activity – are a ubiquitous challenge for all autonomous systems aiming at long-term operations in both indoor and outdoor settings.

We had 9 contributed papers, a tutorial given by Peter, and invited talks by Michael and Paul Newman.

[**Robust and Multimodal Inference in Factor Graphs**](http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/ICRAWorkshopFactorGraphs) (ICRA 2013

This full-day workshop brought together researchers working on novel approaches for modelling and inference in factor graphs. The goal of the workshop was to discuss techniques that introduce a larger robustness and allow incorporating multi-modal Gaussian or non-Gaussian measurements. New concepts of how to infere multi-modal posteriors were also in the scope of the workshop, as well as novel applications beyond the ubiquitous pose graph SLAM.
I organised this workshop with John Leonard (MIT CSAIL) and Edwin Olson (University of Michigan)
