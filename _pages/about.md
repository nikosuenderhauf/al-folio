I am Chief Investigator of the QUT Centre for Robotics where I lead the Visual Understanding and Learning Program. I am furthermore Chief Investigator of the [Australian Centre for Robotic Vision](http://www.roboticvision.org), and a [Senior Lecturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_lecturer) (roughly equivalent to a tenured Assistant Professor position in the US system) at Queensland University of Technology ([QUT](http://www.qut.edu.au)) in [Brisbane](http://www.lensaloft.com.au/Interactive_tour/BrisbaneDusk/Brisbane.html), Australia.

I conduct [research](projects) in robotic vision, at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. My research interests focus on scene understanding, [semantic SLAM](http://www.semanticslam.ai), and new ways to incorporate semantics into reinforcement learning. I furthermore lead a project on [new benchmarking challenges in robotic vision](http://www.roboticvisionchallenge.org).

I am very proud that my work was recognised through a Google Faculty Research Award (2018) and an Amazon Research Award (2020).

I regularly organise [workshops](workshops) at robotics and computer vision conferences, such as RSS, CVPR, and ICRA. I am member of the editorial board for the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), and co-chair of the Technical Committee on Computer and Roboti Vision of IEEE the Robotics and Automation Society.  I was Associate Editor for the IEEE [Robotics and Automation Letters journal](http://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l) (RA-L) from 2015 to 2019, and served as AE for the IEEE [International Conference on Robotics and Automation](http://www.icra2018.org) (ICRA) 2018 and 2020.
