I am a Chief Investigator of the [Australian Centre for Robotic Vision](http://www.roboticvision.org), and a Senior Lecturer at Queensland University of Technology ([QUT](http://www.qut.edu.au)) in Brisbane, Australia.

I conduct research in robotic vision, at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. My research interests are focus on scene understanding, [semantic SLAM](http://www.semanticslam.ai), and new ways to incorporate semantics into reinforcement learning. I furthermore lead a project on new benchmarking challenges in robotic vision.
I regularly organise workshops at robotics and computer vision conferences, such as RSS, CVPR, and ICRA.
