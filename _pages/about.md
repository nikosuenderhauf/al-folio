I am a Chief Investigator of the [Australian Centre for Robotic Vision](http://www.roboticvision.org), and a [Senior Lecturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_lecturer) (roughly equivalent to a tenured Assistant Professor position in the US system) at Queensland University of Technology ([QUT](http://www.qut.edu.au)) in [Brisbane](http://www.lensaloft.com.au/Interactive_tour/BrisbaneDusk/Brisbane.html), Australia.

I conduct research in robotic vision, at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. My research interests are focus on scene understanding, [semantic SLAM](http://www.semanticslam.ai), and new ways to incorporate semantics into reinforcement learning. I furthermore lead a project on [new benchmarking challenges in robotic vision](http://www.roboticvisionchallenge.org).

I regularly organise [workshops](workshops) at robotics and computer vision conferences, such as RSS, CVPR, and ICRA. I am Associate Editor for the IEEE [Robotics and Automation Letters journal](http://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l) (RA-L), and for the IEEE [International Conference on Robotics and Automation](http://www.icra2018.org) (ICRA).

I obtained my PhD degree with [Chemnitz University of Technology](http://www.tu-chemnitz.de) (chair of [Automation Technology](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/en/index.html), lead by [Prof. Peter Protzel](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/en/team/peterProtzel.html)) in Germany in April 2012. After two more years as a postdoc in Chemnitz I joined the Robotics and Autonomous Systems [Group](https://research.qut.edu.au/ras/) at QUT in Brisbane in March 2014. Since August 2014 I have been working with the [Australian Centre for Robotic Vision](http://www.roboticvision.org).
I joined the faculty at QUT in 2017 as a tenured Lecturer and have been promoted to [Senior Lecturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_lecturer) in 2018. I was appointed Chief Investigator of the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision in 2018.
