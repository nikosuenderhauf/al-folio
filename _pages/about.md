I am a Chief Investigator of the [Australian Centre for Robotic Vision](http://www.roboticvision.org), and a [Senior Lecturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_lecturer) (roughly equivalent to a tenured Assistant Professor position in the US system) at Queensland University of Technology ([QUT](http://www.qut.edu.au)) in [Brisbane](http://www.lensaloft.com.au/Interactive_tour/BrisbaneDusk/Brisbane.html), Australia.

I conduct research in robotic vision, at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. My research interests are focus on scene understanding, [semantic SLAM](http://www.semanticslam.ai), and new ways to incorporate semantics into reinforcement learning. I furthermore lead a project on [new benchmarking challenges in robotic vision](http://www.roboticvisionchallenge.org).

I regularly organise [workshops](workshops) at robotics and computer vision conferences, such as RSS, CVPR, and ICRA. I am Associate Editor for the IEEE [Robotics and Automation Letters journal](http://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l) (RA-L), and for the IEEE [International Conference on Robotics and Automation](http://www.icra2018.org) (ICRA).
