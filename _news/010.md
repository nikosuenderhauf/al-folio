I have been nominated and appointed as one of two co-chairs for the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society [Technical Committee on Robot Vision](https://www.ieee-ras.org/computer-robot-vision). I am looking forward to this new role alongside [Davide Scaramuzza](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html) from the University of ZÃ¼rich.
