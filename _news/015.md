Our workshop proposal at ECCV has been accepted! We will organise a half-day workshop on [Beyond mAP: Reasessing the Evaluation of Object Detectors](https://nikosuenderhauf.github.io/roboticvisionchallenges/eccv2020.html) and will run our [Probabilistic Object Detection Challenge](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20597) again.
