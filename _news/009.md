We will organise a workshop at [IROS](https://www.iros2019.org/) in Macau on the topic of [The Importance of Uncertainty in Deep Learning for Robotics](https://nikosuenderhauf.github.io/roboticvisionchallenges/iros2019). I am really excited about this topic!

A paper lead by Quazi Marufur Rahman with Feras Dayoub will be presented at IROS as well. Read the preview here: [Did You Miss the Sign? A False Negative Alarm System for Traffic Sign Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06391).
