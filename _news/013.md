I had a fantastic week at the [IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Summer School on Deep Learning for Robot Vision](http://robotvision2019.amtc.cl/) in Santiago, Chile! It felt very rewarding to interact with around 100 undergraduate, Master's and PhD students from Chile, South America, and around the world -- the next generation of robotics researchers.

I gave an introduction to deep learning and two more lectures about two of my favourite research topics: uncertainty and reliability of deep learning, and semantic object-based SLAM.
