Our paper [Residual Reactive Navigation: Combining Classical and Learned Navigation Strategies for Deployment in Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10972) has been accepted for ICRA 2020. In this work led by Krishan Rana, we focus on improving the efficiency and generalisation of learned navigation strategies when transferred from their training environment to previously unseen environment. Check out the paper on [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10972), and the [project website](https://github.com/krishanrana/2D_SRRN). [Code](https://github.com/krishanrana/2D_SRRN) is available too.
