  abstract={The application of deep learning in robotics leads
to very specific problems and research questions that are
typically not addressed by the computer vision and machine
learning communities. In this paper we discuss a number
of robotics-specific learning, reasoning, and embodiment challenges
for deep learning. We explain the need for better evaluation
metrics, highlight the importance and unique challenges for
deep robotic learning in simulation, and explore the spectrum
between purely data-driven and model-driven approaches. We
hope this paper provides a motivating overview of important
research directions to overcome the current limitations, and
help fulfill the promising potentials of deep learning in robotics.},
