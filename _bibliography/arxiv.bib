  author={S{\"u}nderhauf, Niko},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.07376},
  year={2019},
  abstract={Emerging object-based SLAM algorithms can build a graph representation of an environment comprising nodes for robot poses and object landmarks. However, while this map will contain static objects such as furniture or appliances, many moveable objects (e.g. the car keys, the glasses, or a magazine), are not suitable as landmarks and will not be part of the map due to their non-static nature. We show that Graph Convolutional Networks can learn navigation policies to find such unmapped objects by learning to exploit the hidden probabilistic model that governs where these objects appear in the environment. The learned policies can generalise to object classes unseen during training by using word vectors that express semantic similarity as representations for object nodes in the graph. Furthermore, we show that the policies generalise to unseen environments with only minimal loss of performance. We demonstrate that pre-training the policy network with a proxy task can significantly speed up learning, improving sample efficiency.},

@article{Jablonsky18geometric,
  title={{An Orientation Factor for Object-Oriented SLAM}},
  author={Natalie Jablonsky and Michael Milford and Niko S\"underhauf},
  year={2018},
  journal = {{arXiv preprint}},
  abstract = {Current approaches to object-oriented SLAM lack the ability to incorporate prior knowledge of the scene geometry, such as the expected global orientation of objects. We overcome this limitation by proposing a geometric factor that constrains the global orientation of objects in the map, depending on the objects’ semantics. This new geometric factor is a first example of how semantics can inform and improve geometry in object-oriented SLAM. We implement the geometric factor for the recently proposed QuadricSLAM that represents landmarks as dual quadrics. The factor probabilistically models the quadrics’ major axes to be either perpendicular to or aligned with the direction of gravity, depending on their semantic class. Our experiments on simulated and real-world datasets show that using the proposed factors to incorporate prior knowledge improves both the trajectory and landmark quality.},
