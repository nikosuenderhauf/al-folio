  abstract={The computer vision and robotics research communities are each strong. However progress in computer vision has become turbo-charged in recent years due to big data, GPU computing, novel learning algorithms and a very effective research methodology. By comparison, progress in robotics seems slower. It is true that robotics came later to exploring the potential of learning -- the advantages over the well-established body of knowledge in dynamics, kinematics, planning and control is still being debated, although reinforcement learning seems to offer real potential. However, the rapid development of computer vision compared to robotics cannot be only attributed to the former's adoption of deep learning. In this paper, we argue that the gains in computer vision are due to research methodology -- evaluation under strict constraints versus experiments; bold numbers versus videos.}

  title={{Where are the Keys? -- Learning Object-Centric Navigation Policies on Semantic Maps with Graph Convolutional Networks}},
  author={S{\"u}nderhauf, Niko},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.07376},
  year={2019},
  abstract={Emerging object-based SLAM algorithms can build a graph representation of an environment comprising nodes for robot poses and object landmarks. However, while this map will contain static objects such as furniture or appliances, many moveable objects (e.g. the car keys, the glasses, or a magazine), are not suitable as landmarks and will not be part of the map due to their non-static nature. We show that Graph Convolutional Networks can learn navigation policies to find such unmapped objects by learning to exploit the hidden probabilistic model that governs where these objects appear in the environment. The learned policies can generalise to object classes unseen during training by using word vectors that express semantic similarity as representations for object nodes in the graph. Furthermore, we show that the policies generalise to unseen environments with only minimal loss of performance. We demonstrate that pre-training the policy network with a proxy task can significantly speed up learning, improving sample efficiency.},

  title={{An Orientation Factor for Object-Oriented SLAM}},
  author={Natalie Jablonsky and Michael Milford and Niko S\"underhauf},
  year={2018},
  journal = {{arXiv preprint}},
  abstract = {Current approaches to object-oriented SLAM lack the ability to incorporate prior knowledge of the scene geometry, such as the expected global orientation of objects. We overcome this limitation by proposing a geometric factor that constrains the global orientation of objects in the map, depending on the objects’ semantics. This new geometric factor is a first example of how semantics can inform and improve geometry in object-oriented SLAM. We implement the geometric factor for the recently proposed QuadricSLAM that represents landmarks as dual quadrics. The factor probabilistically models the quadrics’ major axes to be either perpendicular to or aligned with the direction of gravity, depending on their semantic class. Our experiments on simulated and real-world datasets show that using the proposed factors to incorporate prior knowledge improves both the trajectory and landmark quality.},
