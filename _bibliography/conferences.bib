  title={LoST? Appearance-Invariant Place Recognition for Opposite Viewpoints using Visual Semantics},
  author={Garg, Sourav and S\"underhauf, Niko and Milford, Michael},
  booktitle={{Proc. of Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS)}},
  year={2018},
  link={https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05526},
  abstract={In this paper we develop a suite of novel semantic- and appearance-based techniques to enable for the first time high performance place recognition in the challenging scenario of recognizing places when returning from the opposite direction. We first propose a novel Local Semantic Tensor (LoST) descriptor of images using the convolutional feature maps from a state-of-the-art dense semantic segmentation network. Then, to verify the spatial semantic arrangement of the top matching candidates, we develop a novel approach for mining semantically-salient keypoint correspondences. },

  title={{Dropout Sampling for Robust Object Detection in Open-Set Conditions}},
  author={Dimity Miller and Lachlan Nicholson and Feras Dayoub and Niko S\"underhauf},
  year={2018},
  booktitle = {{Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)}},
  abstract = {Dropout Variational Inference, or Dropout Sampling, has been recently proposed as an
approximation technique for Bayesian Deep Learning and evaluated for image classification
and regression tasks. This paper investigates the utility of Dropout Sampling for object
detection for the first time. We demonstrate how label uncertainty can be extracted from a
state-of-the-art object detection system via Dropout Sampling. We show that this uncertainty
can be utilized to increase object detection performance under the open-set conditions that
are typically encountered in robotic vision. We evaluate this approach on a large synthetic
dataset with 30,000 images, and a real-world dataset captured by a mobile robot in a
versatile campus environment.},

  author={Trung T. Pham and Thanh-Toan Do and Niko S\"underhauf and Ian Reid and Michael Milford},
  year={2018},
  booktitle = {{Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)}},
  abstract = {This paper presents SceneCut, a novel approach to jointly discover previously unseen
objects and non-object surfaces using a single RGB-D image. SceneCut's joint reasoning
over scene semantics and geometry allows a robot to detect and segment object instances
in complex scenes where modern deep learning-based methods either fail to separate
object instances, or fail to detect objects that were not seen during training. SceneCut
automatically decomposes a scene into meaningful regions which either represent objects
or scene surfaces. The decomposition is qualified by an unified energy function over
objectness and geometric fitting. We show how this energy function can be optimized
efficiently by utilizing hierarchical segmentation trees.},
