  abstract={We present an approach for efficiently learning goal-directed navigation policies on a mobile robot, from only a single coverage traversal of recorded data. The navigation agent learns an effective policy over a diverse action space in a large heterogeneous environment consisting of more than 2km of travel, through buildings and outdoor regions that collectively exhibit large variations in visual appearance, self-similarity, and connectivity. We compare pretrained visual encoders that enable precomputation of visual embeddings to achieve a throughput of tens of thousands of transitions per second at training time on a commodity desktop computer, allowing agents to learn from millions of trajectories of experience in a matter of hours. We propose multiple forms of computationally efficient stochastic augmentation to enable the learned policy to generalise beyond these precomputed embeddings, and demonstrate successful deployment of the learned policy on the real robot without fine tuning, despite environmental appearance differences at test time.},

For the first two problems we generate images from a complex 3D environment with systematically varying camera paths, camera viewpoints and lighting conditions. For the first time we are able to systematically characterise the performance of these algorithms as paths and lighting conditions change. In particular, we are able to systematically generate varying camera viewpoint datasets that would be difficult or impossible to generate in the real world. We also compare algorithm results for a camera in a real environment and a simulated camera in a simulation model of that real environment. Finally, for the object recognition domain, we generate labelled image data and characterise the viewpoint dependency of a current convolution neural network in performing object recognition. Together these results provide a multi-domain demonstration of the beneficial properties of using simulation to characterise and analyse a wide range of robotic vision algorithms.},

Motivated by their ongoing success in various visual recognition tasks, we build our system upon a state-of-the-art convolutional network. We overcome its closed-set limitations by complementing the network with a series of one-vs-all classifiers that can learn to recognize new semantic classes online. Prior domain knowledge is incorporated by embedding the classification system into a Bayesian filter framework that also ensures temporal coherence. We evaluate the classification accuracy of the system on a robot that maps a variety of places on our campus in real-time. We show how semantic information can boost robotic object detection performance and how the semantic map can be used to modulate the robot's behaviour during navigation tasks. The system is made available to the community as a ROS module.}

to change parts of the topological structure of the graph
during the optimization process. The back-end can thereby
discard loop closures and converge towards correct solutions
even in the presence of false positive loop closures. This largely
increases the overall robustness of the SLAM system and closes
a gap between the sensor-driven front-end and the back-end
optimizers. We demonstrate the approach and present results
both on large scale synthetic and real-world dataset},

  abstract={Our paper explores the performance of a recently proposed incremental smoother in the context of nonlinear sensor fusion for a real-world UAV. This efficient factor graph based smoothing approach has a number of advantages compared to conventional filtering techniques like the EKF or its variants. It can more easily incorporate asynchronous and delayed measurements from sensors operating at different rates and is supposed to be less error-prone in highly nonlinear settings. We compare the novel incremental smoothing approach based on iSAM2 against our conventional EKF based sensor fusion framework. Unlike previously presented work, the experiments are not only performed in simulation, but also on a real-world quadrotor UAV system using IMU, optical flow and altitude measurements.},

In contrast to the established RGB-D devices that are both expensive and comparably heavy, the Kinect is light-weight and especially low-cost. It provides dense color and depth information and can be readily applied to a variety of tasks in the robotics domain. We apply the Kinect on a UAV in an indoor corridor scenario. The sensor extracts a 3D point cloud of the environment that is further processed on-board to identify walls, obstacles, and the position and orientation of the UAV inside the corridor. Subsequent controllers for altitude, position, velocity, and heading enable the UAV to autonomously operate in this indoor environment.}

squares optimization and thus are not robust against outliers
like data association errors and false positive loop closure
detections. Our paper presents and evaluates a robust back-end
formulation for SLAM using switchable constraints. Instead
of proposing yet another appearance-based data association
technique, our system is able to recognize and reject outliers
during the optimization. This is achieved by making
the topology of the underlying factor graph representation
subject to the optimization instead of keeping it fixed. The
evaluation shows that the approach can deal with up to 1000
false positive loop closure constraints on various datasets. This
largely increases the robustness of the overall SLAM system
and closes a gap between the sensor-driven front-end and the
back-end optimizers.},
