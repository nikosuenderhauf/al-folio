  abstract={In this paper we develop a suite of novel semantic- and appearance-based techniques to enable for the first time high performance place recognition in the challenging scenario of recognizing places when returning from the opposite direction. We first propose a novel Local Semantic Tensor (LoST) descriptor of images using the convolutional feature maps from a state-of-the-art dense semantic segmentation network. Then, to verify the spatial semantic arrangement of the top matching candidates, we develop a novel approach for mining semantically-salient keypoint correspondences. },

approximation technique for Bayesian Deep Learning and evaluated for image classification
and regression tasks. This paper investigates the utility of Dropout Sampling for object
detection for the first time. We demonstrate how label uncertainty can be extracted from a
state-of-the-art object detection system via Dropout Sampling. We show that this uncertainty
can be utilized to increase object detection performance under the open-set conditions that
are typically encountered in robotic vision. We evaluate this approach on a large synthetic
dataset with 30,000 images, and a real-world dataset captured by a mobile robot in a

automatically decomposes a scene into meaningful regions which either represent objects

objectness and geometric fitting. We show how this energy function can be optimized
efficiently by utilizing hierarchical segmentation trees.},

The majority of research to date has addressed these mapping challenges separately, focusing on either geometric or semantic mapping. In this paper we address the problem of building environmental maps that include both semantically meaningful, object-level entities and point- or mesh-based geometrical representations. We simultaneously build geometric point cloud models of previously unseen instances of known object classes and create a map that contains these object models as central entities. Our system leverages sparse, feature-based RGB-D SLAM, image-based deep-learning object detection and 3D unsupervised segmentation.},

We introduce a range of condition variations to explore the robustness of these features, including: translation, scaling, rotation, shading and occlusion. Evaluations on the Flavia dataset demonstrate that in ideal imaging conditions, combining traditional and Conv Net features yields state-of-the art performance with an average accuracy of 97.3%±0:6% compared to traditional features which obtain an average accuracy of 91.2%±1:6%. Further experiments show that this combined classification approach consistently outperforms the best set of traditional features by an average of 5.7% for all of the evaluated condition variations.}

In this paper we investigate the use of a photo-realistic simulation tool to address these challenges, in three specific domains: robust place recognition, visual SLAM and object recognition. For the first two problems we generate images from a complex 3D environment with systematically varying camera paths, camera viewpoints and lighting conditions. For the first time we are able to systematically characterise the performance of these algorithms as paths and lighting conditions change. In particular, we are able to systematically generate varying camera viewpoint datasets that would be difficult or impossible to generate in the real world. We also compare algorithm results for a camera in a real environment and a simulated camera in a simulation model of that real environment. Finally, for the object recognition domain, we generate labelled image data and characterise the viewpoint dependency of a current convolution neural network in performing object recognition. Together these results provide a multi-domain demonstration of the beneficial properties of using simulation to characterise and analyse a wide range of robotic vision algorithms.},

Motivated by their ongoing success in various visual recognition tasks, we build our system upon a state-of-the-art convolutional network. We overcome its closed-set limitations by complementing the network with a series of one-vs-all classifiers that can learn to recognize new semantic classes online. Prior domain knowledge is incorporated by embedding the classification system into a Bayesian filter framework that also ensures temporal coherence. We evaluate the classification accuracy of the system on a robot that maps a variety of places on our campus in real-time. We show how semantic information can boost robotic object detection performance and how the semantic map can be used to modulate the robot's behaviour during navigation tasks. The system is made available to the community as a ROS module.}

proposes a novel online method that identifies and excludes

Bayesian inference problem in a factor graph and combine
the recently developed concept of switchable constraints with

We furthermore introduce the concepts of auxiliary updates and
factor graph pruning in order to accelerate convergence while
keeping the graph size and required runtime bounded. A realworld

able to successfully localize despite a large number of satellite
